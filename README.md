# LibreArm

LibreArm is an open‚Äësource iOS app that connects directly to the **QardioArm** blood pressure monitor via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and saves readings into **Apple Health**.  
This project exists because Qardio, Inc. shut down its backend services and app support, leaving the QardioArm hardware functional but unusable with the original app.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Connects to QardioArm over BLE (no Qardio cloud or accounts required)
- Starts and stops a blood pressure measurement directly from the app
- Parses and displays **systolic**, **diastolic**, **MAP**, and **heart rate**
- Saves the **final measurement only** (debounced) into **Apple Health**
- Simple SwiftUI interface with live status and history through HealthKit
- 100% local: no accounts, no data leaves your device

---

## üì≤ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ptylr/LibreArm.git
   cd LibreArm
   ```

2. Open the project in Xcode:
   ```bash
   open LibreArm.xcodeproj
   ```

3. Ensure you have:
   - Xcode 15+
   - iOS 16+ device (QardioArm does not work in the simulator)
   - An Apple ID signed into Xcode (free developer account works for local builds)

4. On first run you‚Äôll be prompted for:
   - **Bluetooth access** (to connect to the cuff)
   - **Health access** (to save readings)

---

## üîß Development Notes

- **Language & UI**: Swift + SwiftUI
- **Bluetooth**: CoreBluetooth (service 0x1810, char 0x2A35 + vendor control UUID `583CB5B3-875D-40ED-9098-C39EB0C1983D`)
- **Health**: HealthKit (blood pressure and heart rate types)
- **App Icon**: Custom design included in `Assets.xcassets`

The app implements a debounce strategy so that **only the final reading** after a measurement is saved, preventing dozens of partial entries in Health.

---

## üõ° Privacy

- LibreArm does **not** connect to the internet.  
- All readings stay on your device.  
- Data is saved into **Apple Health** if permission is granted.
