# LibreArm

LibreArm is an open-source iOS app that connects directly to the **QardioArm** blood pressure monitor via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and saves readings into **Apple Health**.  
This project exists because Qardio, Inc. shut down its backend services and app support, leaving the QardioArm hardware functional but unusable with the original app.

- üì≤ **Available on the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/librearm/id6752661389)**  
- üíª Open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/ptylr/LibreArm) for transparency and community contributions  

---

## ‚ú® Features (v1.2.0)

- Connects to QardioArm over BLE (no Qardio cloud or accounts required)
- **Connection management**:
  - Start scanning automatically on launch
  - Retry button with 30-second connection timeout (hidden when connected)
  - Device status always visible in the UI
- **Measurement handling**:
  - ‚úÖ Improved reliability: readings are now only saved to Health **once the full blood pressure cycle is complete**
  - Single, debounced save to HealthKit (no partial inflating entries)
  - Dynamic **Start/Stop button**  
    - Blue *Start Measurement* when idle  
    - Red *Stop Measurement* while inflating, sends cancel on tap
- **UI improvements**:
  - Centered title and status
  - App icon displayed in header
  - Card-style layout for latest reading (systolic, diastolic, MAP, heart rate)
  - Developer credit and GitHub link footer
- 100% local: no accounts, no data leaves your device

## üì≤ Installation

### 1. From the App Store (recommended)
Download directly from the App Store:  
üëâ [LibreArm on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/librearm/id6752661389)  

### 2. Build from source
If you‚Äôd like to build it yourself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ptylr/LibreArm.git
cd LibreArm
open LibreArm.xcodeproj
```

Requirements:
- Xcode 15+
- iOS 16+ device (QardioArm does not work in the simulator)
- Apple ID signed into Xcode (free dev account OK for local builds)

On first run you‚Äôll be prompted for:
- **Bluetooth access** (to connect to the cuff)
- **Health access** (to save readings)

## üîß Development Notes

- **Language & UI**: Swift + SwiftUI
- **Bluetooth**: CoreBluetooth (service 0x1810, char 0x2A35 + vendor control UUID `583CB5B3-875D-40ED-9098-C39EB0C1983D`)
- **Health**: HealthKit (blood pressure and heart rate types)
- **App Icon**: Custom design included in `Assets.xcassets`

The app implements a debounce strategy so that **only the final reading** after a measurement is saved, preventing dozens of partial entries in Health.  
As of v1.1.1, LibreArm further ensures that **both systolic and diastolic readings are present** before saving to Apple Health.

---

## üõ° Privacy

- LibreArm does **not** connect to the internet.  
- All readings stay on your device.  
- Data is saved into **Apple Health** if permission is granted.
